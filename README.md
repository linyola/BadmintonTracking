## Implement
There are three steps in badminton tracking, identifying the course area, tracking badminton tracks, deleting noise and non-competition tracks.
In this instance, some noise from non-current field is removed according to context. There is also a work difficulty, how to transform 2D into 3D coordinates and determine whether the badminton is landing. There are some ideas for this, such as the direction of badminton rebound.
